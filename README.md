# Tic_Tac_Toe

This file contains a simple two player tic-tac-toe game written in Processing, 
which I developed in 2019. I created this project as a supplement to my first intro to 
programming course, and had a lot of fun experimenting with control logic, functions, 
GUIs, reading user input (from mouse and keyboard) and all sorts of other stuff!

This is not a perfect program, but it shows a simple, organized, and completed solution 
to a simple game design idea. After the user is promted for player names (player 1 and 2)
a game board is opened. The game is then played by clicking in empty boxes during alternating 
turns, as shown:

The game can result with a single winner, or in a tie!
